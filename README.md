# Understanding-Climatic-Upheaval

In this project, the minacious human crisis using the science of data has been tackled. The global change in Earthâ€™s surface temperature since 1750 has been explored and interesting analysis and visualizations for the same have been presented. This data model predicts the atmospheric conditions in the upcoming years to be able to take the necessary steps required to avoid an environmental catastrophe in the future.
